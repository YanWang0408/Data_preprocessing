Images: 
     Images: Images are read only templates used to create containers. 
     Images are created with the docker build command, wither by us or by other docker users.
     Images are composed of layers of other images.
     Images are stored in a Docker registry.
Containers: 
     Containers: if image is a class, then a container is an instance of a class - a runtime obkect.
     Containers are lightweight and portable encapsulations of an environment in which to run applications.
     Containers are created from images. Inside a container, it has all the binaries and dependencies needed to run the application.
Registries and Repositories:
     A registry is where we store our images.
     You can host your own registry, or you can use Docker's public registry which is called DockerHub.
     Inside a registry, images are stored in repositories.
     Docker repository is a collection of different dcker images with the same name, that have different tags, 
     each tag usually represents a different version of the image.
